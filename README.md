# Kojin's Blog

This is Kojin's blog built in Deno (not Node.js) and Fresh (not React.js).

It's lightweight, doesn't use DB, and hosted on Deno Deploy.

### Usage

Start the project:

Locally:
```
deno task start:dev
```

Production:
```
deno task start
```

Both will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
