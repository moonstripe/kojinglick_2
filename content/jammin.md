# Jammin' Out With Xerf

I just need to express my love an appreciation for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheXMusicArchive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xearching for Sounds</a>, an amazing music youtube channel.

A lot of the music is from the '70s through the '00s in Japan, and it has that jazzy, funky, pop-sound of the early internet era. There's something earnest in the music's glossy production and  exuberant optimism in that era. Countless hours have been spent jammin' out to his tunes and coding. Some of the best programming music there is.
