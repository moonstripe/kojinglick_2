## Elaborate.

Fine. Fresh's real sell is the ability to churn out solid web development that makes use of reactivity, while having more the DX of making static HTML websites. It's raw, it's unstructured, it's fast. My obvious first instinct is to see how far I can push the solid web development stuff while having a developing experience like throwing pasta at a wall and seeing what sticks. A great stress test is the upper end of client asks for static product pages: 3D graphics!
