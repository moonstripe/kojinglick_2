I've always had a little trouble communicating effectively with myself. The difficulty often comes from the sense that emotions exist behind a cloudy wall, and the best I can do is feel the shape of what it actually is. I may never understand what a pure version of my own anger or sadness might actually be. 

But that makes it even more important to spend as much time trying to make that foggy connection. Emotions change us and we change emotions, so the more often I check in, the more likely I will be able to spot an anomaly in the future.

Regardless I should look for a professional somewhere.
