# The tree and the bird

1663442993

how selfish is the tree  
who grows entitled  
to the bird's talons.  

why does the tree  
continue into the sky  
paving the bird's domain?  

does the tree not know  
that its solitude  
is just the bird's freedom?  

silently in the breeze  
the tree etches another ring  
of growth into the lonely sky.
