To everyone and no one, hello. 

On the other side of viral success, view counts in the millions, and the other isolated clusters of immense internet traffic, most of the internet lays empty. I’ve started a handful of online presences over my life: very few garnered even the attention of my in-person friends and family. I still wonder what all of those abandoned blogs are doing. They’re probably now trafficking pornography or other scams.

Perhaps this too will go the way of my adolescent blogs and course-mandated tweeting. But each time I start one of these, there’s a scene of wonder. Like walking into a desert, I lay feeble claim to a little corner of a vast, unknowable expanse.
